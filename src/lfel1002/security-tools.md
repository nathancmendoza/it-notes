# Security tools in rust

## Examples of tools

### ALF.rs 

- A fuzzing tool for discovering vulnerabilities in software
- Can discover crashes, hangs, and memory problems
- Uses genetic algorithms to mutate inputs and monitors code behavior and what statements are being run

### honggfuzz

- Similar to ALF.rs, but allows fuzzing of *both* rust and non-rust programs

### RustScan

- A high-speed network scanning tool

### Rustls

- A TLS library for network applications
- Manages the handshake process and negotiate cryptographic algorithms and keys
- After connection is established, maintian secure communication by encrypting and decrypting data

### cargo-audit

- Audits the `Cargo.lock` for vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Cross references a database of known vulnerabilities that includes details
    - About the vulnerability
    - Versions affected
    - Any remediation steps

### RustSec

- A security advisory organization and database for rust
- Acts as a central hub for reporting security vulnerabilities in rust crates

### Cargo-Geiger

- Scans projects for use of unsafe code
- Enables regular scanning of licensing and safety compliance

### Parity Ethereum

- An ethereum client built in rust
- Includes support for proof-of-work and proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms

## Usage of tools

```rust
use std::fs::File; 
use std::io::{self, BufRead, BufReader}; 
use regex::Regex; 

fn main() { 
    let file_path = "input.txt"; 

    // Open the input file and print to standard error 
    let file = match File::open(file_path) { 
        Ok(file) => file, 
        Err(error) => { 
            eprintln!("Error opening the file: {}", error); 
            return; 
        } 
    };

    // Create a BufReader to efficiently read the file line by line 
    let reader = BufReader::new(file); 

    // Define a regular expression to match potential passwords or API keys 
    let password_regex = Regex::new(r"(?i)(password|api[_\s]?key)[:=]\s*(\w+)").unwrap();    

    // Perform the security check by scanning each line of the file for (line_number, line) in reader.lines().enumerate() { 
        let line = match line { 
            Ok(line) => line, 
            Err(error) => { 
                eprintln!("Error reading line {}: {}", line_number + 1, error); 
                continue; 
            } 
        }; 

        // Search for matches in the current line using the password_regex 
        if password_regex.is_match(&line) { 
            println!("Potential security issue found in line {}: {}", line_number + 1, line); 
        } 
    } 
}
```

This example illustrates a simple Rust-based tool for scanning files for potential security issues.

1) Opens the file
2) Reads the contents of the file line-by-line
3) Check that a line matches the defined regex pattern for detecting a password
