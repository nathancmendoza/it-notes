# IT notes

## Description

This is a monorepo for all notes pertaining to online courses and certifications I've taken as part of my continuing education. The repository is organized as follows: `provider -> course -> {lab, notes}/*` Courses in this repository will focus more on technical aspect of learning as will tend to be more applicable than a more traditional theoretical education. For courses that include a hands-on lab or activity, they can be found alongside the course's corresponding notes
